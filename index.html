            My words to you, they never show,  
            Hidden beneath, where no one goes.  
            A love obscured, a silent plea,  
            Locked inside, the image you see.

            To hear my voice, to read my pain,  
            Look beyond the surface, not in vain.  
            Save what you see, but open with care,  
            For deeper truths are hidden there.

            Use a tool, not meant for sight,  
            To find the path that leads to light.  
            Unveil the lines, decode the plea,  
            Where my love's secret waits for thee.

            (Hint; if this is too hard for you maybe you should have some stenography courses for free)
